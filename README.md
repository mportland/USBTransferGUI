# USBTransferGUI
Shell program written with Python using TKinter as UI. GUI shell interface for an executable to be ran from 
both read and write computers of a USB transfer process.

V1.0 is first iteration, more serialized
v1.1 is second iteration, provides more functionality for presentation purposes. 
 
Written in Python 3.6 originally, regressed to 3.5 after I found that I could not deploy to Windows Computers from 3.6 with pyinstaller. 
Successfully deployed with pyinstaller once I changed versions.
